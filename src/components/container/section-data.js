          My summer spent with the Snag team brought an interesting blend of old codebases, Mario Kart, modern backend practices with C#,
          and countless dodged Nerf bullets. Fellow intern <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/medenzon/">Michael Edenzon</a> and I were
          given a single task: rewrite the companyâ€™s employee assessment portal in a DotNet Core + SQL application. This added a level of
          creative independence most software internships miss, allowing us to write a new application from the ground up.
